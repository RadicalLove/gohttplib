# gohttplib

Shared library that exposes Go's `net/http.Server` with externally-bindable
handlers.

This is a silly project for experimenting with Go v1.5 buildmodes.

**Status**: Tiny subset of the http.HandlerFunc callback gets passed to a C handler callback successfully.


## Getting Started

Requirements:

- Go 1.5 or newer.
- C example: make, gcc
- Python example: cffi, python-cffi

```
$ git clone https://github.com/shazow/gohttplib/
$ cd gohttplib
$ make examples
```

### Example: C

C example can be linked against a shared object (`libgohttp.so` generated by
`go build -buildmode=c-shared`) or against a static library archive
(`libgohttp.a` generated by `go build -buildmode=c-archive`). By default, we
link against the shared object because that's what the Python example uses too.

Linked against our shared object:

```
$ make example-c
$ DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=build/ ./build/gohttp-c
```

Note that you'll need to make sure that `libgohttp.so` is findable at runtime.

Now you can request `http://localhost:8000/hello` and the C handler in
`examples/c/main.c` will handle it!

Linked against our static library archive:

```
$ make example-c-static
$ ./build/gohttp-c-static
```

The static archive gets built into the binary so it's more portable during
runtime. Note the size differences:

```
8.8K  gohttp-c
5.1M  gohttp-c-static
7.5M  libgohttp.a
6.9M  libgohttp.so
```

### Example: Python

The Python example uses [python-cffi](https://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
(you'll need python-cffi installed) to link against the shared object.

```
$ make example-python
$ python examples/python/run.py
```

The server is now listening on `http://localhost:8001`.

**Outstanding issue**: [Get cffi to link against our static archive](https://github.com/shazow/gohttplib/issues/4)
